#Common Parameters

# Radius of the largest cell - This is used the set the region of interest around each cell for locally processing it. Given that the radius of a cell is an invariant to the imaging protocol, it is best to define ROI limits from the image spacing information. This information is also important in determining the kernel widths of smoothing filters. Instead of hard-coding the sigma/variances, it may be best to define their widths in real coordinates (for example, sigma = radius/10 etc) and then use image spacing to assign the values in terms of image pixels. Also, the cell radius helps in eliminating components with a smaller radius, especially during seed-point detection.

#LargestCellRadius used here

# Actually, this is a lower-bound on the radius values. In elliptic nuclei, we want the minor axis (b) measurement here. The main purpose is to eliminate spurious seed points. Note the value of the distance map at the center of a nuclei is equal roughly to the minor axis radius. So, the input should be (b-epsilon). epsilon is some small quantity. I have put a very large epsilon. But this parameter needs to be ideally 2.0 micrometer.
